def largest_n_items(items, n):
    """Return the `n` largest integers in list, in ascending order.

    You can assume that `n` will be less than the length of the list.

    For example::

        >>> largest_n_items([2, 6006, 700, 42, 6, 59], 3)
        [59, 700, 6006]

    It should work when `n` is 0::

        >>> largest_n_items([3, 4, 5], 0)
        []

    If there are duplicates in the list, they should be counted
    separately::

        >>> largest_n_items([3, 3, 3, 2, 1], 2)
        [3, 3]
    """

    return []
